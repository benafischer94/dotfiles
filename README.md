# dotfiles

Despite trying for years to be able to move between systems without the need to customize and just be up and running, I've found there's some QoL things I do enjoy on a system. Attempting to get them organized and in a way for quick move-in.

Will likely eventually contain documents of most frequently used applications in addition to dot files. Likely some ansible to facilitate the move in as well.

Some basic structure:
```
.
├── linux
|   └── 
├── shared
│   └── 
└── windows
    └── 
```
Each OS type gets a folder for files that are only used there.
Any that can float between or are common will be placed in shared, and the on move-in they can be copied over to the appropriate place.
