# Notes and ToDo

Notes for cleanup and general todo

## Linux notes

RegEx fu is very weak/rusty. Need to improve. Current use case:
* wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/latest get the version number, then replace to pull down:
* https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/{version}/downloads/hugo_extended_{version}_Linux-64bit.tar.gz follow that up with a tar xvf, then chmod +x, mv to /usr/local/bin/hugo maybe just symlink it from home? not decided just yet.

## Windows Notes

* enable WSL
* install github desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
